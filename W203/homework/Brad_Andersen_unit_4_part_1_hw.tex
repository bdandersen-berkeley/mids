% ----- Question 1: Best Game in the Casino --------------------------------------------------------

\item \textbf{Best Game in the Casino}

You flip a fair coin 3 times, and get a different amount of money depending on how many heads you get. For 0 heads, you get \$0. For 1 head, you get \$2. For 2 heads, you get \$4. Your expected winnings from the game are \$6. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item How much do you get paid if the coin comes up heads 3 times?
\end{enumerate}
Because:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Our coin-flipping activities are divided into three separate \textit{trials}
    \item Each trial flip has only two outcomes: heads or tails
    \item Each trial flip is independent of the others
    \item The probability of heads or tails is consistent from one trial flip to the next
\end{itemize}
our coin-flipping activities can be considered a \textbf{binomial experiment}.\\ \\
Payout is based upon the number of heads resulting in the experiment: 0, 1, 2 or 3.  Probabilities can be calculated using the binomial distribution probability theorem, as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    b(x; n, p) =
    \begin{cases}
    \binom{n}{x}p^{x}(1 - p)^{n - x} & x = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n\\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
where \textit{x} represents the number of heads results, \textit{n} represents the number of trials in the experiment, and \textit{p} represents the probability of the outcome. \\ \\
For example, calculating the probability that the experiment's results include no heads,
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
P(X = 0) = b(0; 3, 0.5) & = \binom{3}{0}p^{0}(1 - 0.5)^{3 - 0} \\
& = \frac{3!}{0!(3 - 0)!} \times 0.5^{0} \times 0.5^{3} \\
& = \frac{6}{6} \times 1 \times 0.125 \\
& = 1 \times 1 \times 0.125 \\
& = 0.125
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Therefore, the probability mass function for the experiment is as follows: \\ \\
\begin{tabular}{c|cccc}
\textit{x} & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
\hline
\textit{p}(\textit{x}) & 0.125 & 0.375 & 0.375 & 0.125 \\
\end{tabular} \\ \\
Payout from the results of the experiment can be considered a function of the discrete random variable \textit{X}, itself the results of the coin-flipping experiment.  If \textit{h}(\textit{X}) is this function, it too is a random variable such that \textit{Y} = \textit{h}(\textit{X}).  The derived probability mass function for \textit{Y} is as follows: \\ \\
\begin{tabular}{c|cccc}
\textit{y} & \$0 & \$2 & \$4 & \$\textit{m} \\
\hline
\textit{p}(\textit{y}) & 0.125 & 0.375 & 0.375 & 0.125 \\
\end{tabular} \\ \\
where \textit{m} represents the winnings for experiment results of three heads, the winnings to be calculated.  Given that we know the expected winnings from the experiment are \$6, winnings for results of three heads can be calculated as follows:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
E(Y) & = E[h(X)] = \sum_{\substack{D}}h(x) \times p(x) \\
& = \$6 = (\$0)(0.125) + (\$2)(0.375) + (\$4)(0.375) + (\textit{m})(0.125) \\
& = \$6 = \$0 + \$0.75 + \$1.50 + (\textit{m})(0.125) \\
& = \$3.75 = (\textit{m})(0.125) \\
& = \$30 = \textit{m}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Therefore, \doubleunderline{winnings for experiment results of three heads are \$30}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(b)]Write down a complete expression for the cumulative probability function for your winnings from the game.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{equation*}
    \textit{F}(\textit{y}) =
    \begin{cases}
    0.125 & 0 \le y < 1 \\
    0.500 & 1 \le y < 2 \\
    0.875 & 2 \le y < 3 \\
    1 & 3 \le y
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*} \\

\item \textbf{Reciprocal Dice}

Let $X$ be a random variable representing the outcome of rolling a 6-sided die.  Before the die is rolled, you are given two options:

\begin{enumerate}
\item You get $1/E(X)$ in dollars right away.
\item You wait until the die is rolled, then get $1/X$ in dollars.
\end{enumerate}

Which option is better for you, in expectation? \\ \\
The probability mass function for a fair six-sided die is as follows: \\ \\
\begin{tabular}{c|cccccc}
\textit{x} & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline
\textit{p}(\textit{x}) & 1/6 & 1/6 & 1/6 & 1/6 & 1/6 & 1/6 \\
\end{tabular} \\ \\
Therefore, the expected value of random variable $X$ can be calculated as follows:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
E(X) & = \sum_{\substack{x \in D}}x \times p(x) \\
& = (1)(1/6) + (2)(1/6) + (3)(1/6) + (4)(1/6) + (5)(1/6) + (6)(1/6)\\
& = 1/6 + 1/3 + 1/2 + 2/3 + 5/6 + 1 \\
& = 21/6 \\
& = 3.50
\end{split}
\end{equation*} \\
Given that the expected value of $X$ is 3.50, $1/E(X)$ equals approximately 0.2857.  Rounding to the nearest cent, one would receive \$0.29 if option a) were chosen prior to the rolling of the die. \\ \\
Given that the die is fair, each of its six sides has an equal probability of appearing when the die is rolled; the probability that any side appears is therefore 1/6, as shown in the probability mass function, above.  If one were to receive $1/X$ dollars representing the roll of the die, payouts for each of the die's six sides (rounded to the nearest cent) are as follows: \\ \\
\begin{tabular}{r|cccccc}
Die roll & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline
Calculated payout & \$1.00 & \$0.50 & \$0.33 & \$0.25 & \$0.20 & \$0.17 \\
\end{tabular} \\ \\
The payout prior to the rolling of the die (\$0.29) is equidistant from the payouts associated with rolling a 3 (\$0.33) and a 4 (\$0.25).  Given that the probability of rolling any one side of the die is equivalent, one would be just as likely to roll a die value associated with a payout \textit{greater than} \$0.29 as \textit{less than} \$0..29.  However, payouts associated with die rolls of 1 or 2 are further from \$0.29 than payouts associated with die rolls of 5 or 6.  Therefore, one could potentially maximize gains (or minimize losses) by selecting option b), \doubleunderline{waiting until the die is rolled and collecting $1/X$ dollars}.
